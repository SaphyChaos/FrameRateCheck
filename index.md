Welcome! This is the page for the FrameRateCheck package (formally known as FPSTool). This tool contains a prefab text object with code to display the current fps each frame. Below is a video demonstrating the package. This is a simple scene in which red illuminating cubes spawn every frame, causing the frame rate to steadily drop as the room gets more crowded and illuminated.

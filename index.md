Welcome! This is the page for the fpsTool package (not fp stool). This tool modifies a string to be the current framerate. Below is a video demonstrating the package. This is a simple scene in which red illuminating cubes spawn every frame, causing the frame rate to steadily drop as the room gets more crowded and illuminated.

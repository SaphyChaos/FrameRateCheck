This package will transform a string into a string of the current framerate.
Under namespace fpstool, and with #include fpstool, <yourstring>.fpstool() or "".fpstool() will return the current framerate.
You can assign a string to a text object attached to a ui object and that will display the fps at runtime.
If you call this function every frame, the exact fps will be hard to read because it will constantly be updating.
